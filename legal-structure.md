Meeting MLETR Requirements

• 10\(1\)\(a\): equivalence in terms of content \(but see

also Article 6 – additional content not precluded

– potential to increase functionality\).

• 10\(1\)\(b\)\(i\) Mechanism for precluding “double

spending”: performance obligation must be

singular.

• 10\(1\)\(b\)\(ii\) Person to whom performance is due

must be identifiable.

• 10\(1\)\(b\)\(iii\) and 10\(2\): techniques to maintain

Meeting MLETR Requirements

\(i\) Operational Rules: framework governing operation of the electronic

system should be geared towards the achievement of desired

outcomes.

\(ii\) Data Integrity: system must incorporate techniques to protect data

from tampering and external attacks.

\(iii\) Unauthorised access and use: Who is permitted to enter data and

method for becoming a system user are relevant considerations, as

well as vulnerabilities to internal attacks.

\(iv\) Security of hardware and software: may bring into play worker

complacency.

\(v\) Audit: system may need to be audited prior to going live, and

regularly thereafter, to check for vulnerabilities.

\(vi\) External Assessment and \(vii\) Industry standards: International

Organisation for Standardisation \(ISO\) provides benchmarks against

which system may be assessed: Technology-specific standards, as

well as general Quality, Risk Management, Business Continuity and

Security Management Standards developed by ISO may apply.
