# Functional and legal equiviliance provisions for dematerilizing shipping documents

  
Visually replicate paper bills, preserving the often industry / custom specific layout;

> b. Replicate the function of paper bills, including a party’s ability to issue, indorse, recut or surrender the e-bill;
>
> c. Replicate the physical transfer of paper bills and, whilst all parties can view an e-bill \(in copy form\), the trading platform restricts access and indorsement to the current lawful holder \(by way of fob and access code\) as the e-bills securely move from one party to the next; and
>
> d. Can be converted into paper bills, allowing them to be finally traded with parties which have not signed up to the ETS platform. However, it is notable that paper bills cannot be converted into e-bills since none of the ETS would be prepared to investigate and effectively warrant the provenance of paper bills and the physical cargo they represent.

Meeting MLETR Requirements

\(i\) Operational Rules: framework governing operation of the electronic

system should be geared towards the achievement of desired

outcomes.

\(ii\) Data Integrity: system must incorporate techniques to protect data

from tampering and external attacks.

\(iii\) Unauthorised access and use: Who is permitted to enter data and

method for becoming a system user are relevant considerations, as

well as vulnerabilities to internal attacks.

\(iv\) Security of hardware and software: may bring into play worker

complacency.

\(v\) Audit: system may need to be audited prior to going live, and

regularly thereafter, to check for vulnerabilities.

\(vi\) External Assessment and \(vii\) Industry standards: International

Organisation for Standardisation \(ISO\) provides benchmarks against

which system may be assessed: Technology-specific standards, as

well as general Quality, Risk Management, Business Continuity and

Security Management Standards developed by ISO may apply.
