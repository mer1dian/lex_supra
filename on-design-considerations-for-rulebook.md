Systems based approach

Often when two companies deal with each other in the course of business, they will use standard form contracts. Often these standard forms contain terms which conflict \(e.g. both parties include a liability waiver in their form\). The 'battle of the forms' refers to the resulting legal dispute arising where both parties accept that a legally binding contract exists, but disagree about whose standard terms apply. Such disputes may be resolved by reference to the 'last document rule', i.e. whichever business sent the last document, or 'fired the last shot' \(often the seller's delivery note\) is held to have issued the final offer and the buyer's organisation is held to have accepted the offer by signing the delivery note or simply accepting and using the delivered goods.

* Laws that fail to achieve their goal
* Laws that lack a citation of references
* whose burdens are greater than their problemsolving benefit
* whose problemsolving benefit and burdens are equal
* whose results cannot be measured
* that interfere with other laws
* that duplicate other laws
* that have not undergone QA analysis within a specified time frame or approval process
