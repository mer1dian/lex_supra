The 2015 revised interpretive guidance generally retains the first six elements of the seven-part test without significant changes. The Commissions slightly modified the fourth and fifth elements to clarify that its interpretation applies to both puts and calls, noting that the fourth and fifth elements do not prohibit “bandwidth contracts” from falling within the forward contract exclusion.



### Forward EVOs - Discerning what qualifies under CFTC Guidance



Under the revised test, an agreement, contract or transaction with EVO may still qualify as a forward contract that is excluded from the swap definition if it meets the following criteria:

1. The embedded optionality does not undermine the overall nature of the agreement, contract or transaction as a forward contract;

2. The predominant feature of the agreement, contract or transaction is actual delivery;

3. The embedded optionality cannot be severed and marketed separately from the overall agreement, contract or transaction in which it is embedded;
