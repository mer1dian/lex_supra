(a)Negotiable Bills.—
(1) A bill of lading is negotiable if the bill—
(A) states that the goods are to be delivered to the order of a consignee; and
(B) does not contain on its face an agreement with the shipper that the bill is not negotiable.
(2) Inserting in a negotiable bill of lading the name of a person to be notified of the arrival of the goods—
(A) does not limit its negotiability; and
(B) is not notice to the purchaser of the goods of a right the named person has to the goods.

(b)Nonnegotiable Bills.—
(1) A bill of lading is nonnegotiable if the bill states that the goods are to be delivered to a consignee. The indorsement of a nonnegotiable bill does not—
(A) make the bill negotiable; or
(B) give the dtransferee any additional right.
(2) A common carrier issuing a nonnegotiable bill of lading must put “nonnegotiable” or “not negotiable” on the bill. This paragraph does not apply to an informal memorandum or acknowledgment.

Functional equivalence of possession is achieved when a reliable method is employed to establish control of that record by a person and to identify the person in control. The notion of control when used as a substitute for possession requires a reliable method for identifying the current party in control of a specific electronic record as the said notion typically focuses on the identity of the person entitled to enforce the rights embodied in the electronic transferable record. The method of identification may be accomplished through a closed system, or through an open system. Under the draft model law, the notion of original and uniqueness has been connected to control. Emphasis has been given to reliably ensure that the claim may be presented to the debtor only once.

Negotiable Bills of Lading

A common carrier issuing a negotiable bill of lading has a lien on the goods covered by the bill for—

\(1\) charges for storage, transportation, and delivery \(including demurrage and terminal charges\), and expenses necessary to preserve the goods or incidental to transporting the goods after the date of the bill; and

\(2\) other charges for which the bill expressly specifies a lien is claimed to the extent the charges are allowed by law and the agreement between the consignor and carrier.

# Functional and legal equiviliance provisions for dematerilizing shipping documents

Visually replicate paper bills, preserving the often industry / custom specific layout;

> b. Replicate the function of paper bills, including a party’s ability to issue, indorse, recut or surrender the e-bill;
>
> c. Replicate the physical transfer of paper bills and, whilst all parties can view an e-bill \(in copy form\), the trading platform restricts access and indorsement to the current lawful holder \(by way of fob and access code\) as the e-bills securely move from one party to the next; and
>
> d. Can be converted into paper bills, allowing them to be finally traded with parties which have not signed up to the ETS platform. However, it is notable that paper bills cannot be converted into e-bills since none of the ETS would be prepared to investigate and effectively warrant the provenance of paper bills and the physical cargo they represent.

Replacement of a transferable document or instrument with an electronic transferable record

1. An electronic transferable record may replace a transferable document or instrument if a reliable method for the change of medium is used.

2. For the change of medium to take effect, a statement indicating a change of medium shall be inserted in the electronic transferable record.

3. Upon issuance of the electronic transferable record in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2, the transferable document or instrument shall be made inoperative and ceases to have any effect or validity.

4. A change of medium in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not affect the rights and obligations of the parties.

\(2\) Other documents

If a document is transferred under this section, no duplicate document in any form may be transferred by any person with respect to the same agricultural product represented by the document, except as authorized by the Secretary.

\(e\) Electronic receipts and electronic documentsExcept as provided in section 242\(h\)\(2\) of this title, notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law:

\(1\) In general

The Secretary may promulgate regulations that authorize the issuance, recording, and transfer of electronic receipts, and the transfer of other electronic documents, in accordance with this subsection.

\(2\)** Electronic receipt or electronic document systems**

• 10\(1\)\(a\): equivalence in terms of content \(but see also Article 6 – additional content not precluded – potential to increase functionality\).

• 10\(1\)\(b\)\(i\) Mechanism for precluding “double pending”: performance obligation must be singular.

• 10\(1\)\(b\)\(ii\) Person to whom performance is due must be identifiable.

• 10\(1\)\(b\)\(iii\) and 10\(2\): techniques to maintain integrity \(any changes to the record must be identifiable\).

\(i\) **Operational Rules**: framework governing operation of the electronic system should be geared towards the achievement of desired outcomes.

\(ii\)** Data Integrity**: system must incorporate techniques to protect data from tampering and external attacks.

\(iii\) **Unauthorised access and use:** Who is permitted to enter data and method for becoming a system user are relevant considerations, as well as vulnerabilities to internal attacks.

\(iv\) **Security of hardware and software:** may bring into play worker complacency.

\(v\) **Audit: system **may need to be audited prior to going live, and regularly thereafter, to check for vulnerabilities.

\(vi\) **External Assessment and \(vii\) Industry standards**: International Organisation for Standardisation \(ISO\) provides benchmarks against which system may be assessed: Technology-specific standards, as well as general Quality, Risk Management, Business Continuity and Security Management Standards developed by ISO may apply.

1. Interpretation

\(1\) “Consignee” means the person entitled to delivery of the goods under the contract of carriage.

\(3\) “Contract particulars” means any information relating to the contract of carriage or to the goods \(including terms, notations, signatures and endorsements\) that is in an electronic transport record.

\(4\) “Controlling party” means the person that is entitled to exercise the right of control.

\(5\) “Electronic communication” means information generated, sent, received or stored by electronic, optical, digital or similar means with the result that the information communicated is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference.

\(6\) “Electronic transport record” means information in one or more messages issued by electronic communication under a contract of carriage by a carrier, including information logically associated with the electronic transport record by attachments or otherwise linked to the electronic transport record contemporaneously with or subsequent to its issue by the carrier, so as to become part of the electronic transport record, that:

\(a\) Evidences the carrier‟s or a performing party‟s receipt of goods under a contract of carriage; and

\(b\) Evidences or contains a contract of carriage.

\(7\) “Exclusive Control” of an electronic transport record is obtained where a reliable method is used to render such record unique.70
