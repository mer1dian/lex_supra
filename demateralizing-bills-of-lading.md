# Dematerializing Supply Chain Documents

Functional equivalence of possession is achieved when a reliable method is employed to establish control of that record by a person and to identify the person in control. The notion of control when used as a substitute for possession requires a reliable method for identifying the current party in control of a specific electronic record as the said notion typically focuses on the identity of the person entitled to enforce the rights embodied in the electronic transferable record. The method of identification may be accomplished through a closed system, or through an open system. Under the draft model law, the notion of original and uniqueness has been connected to control. Emphasis has been given to reliably ensure that the claim may be presented to the debtor only once.

> An indicative list of transferable documents or instruments includes: bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, consignment notes, bills of lading, warehouse receipts, cargo insurance certificates and air waybills.

• 10\(1\)\(a\): equivalence in terms of content \(but see also Article 6 – additional content not precluded – potential to increase functionality\).

• 10\(1\)\(b\)\(i\) Mechanism for precluding “double pending”: performance obligation must be singular.

• 10\(1\)\(b\)\(ii\) Person to whom performance is due must be identifiable.

• 10\(1\)\(b\)\(iii\) and 10\(2\): techniques to maintain integrity \(any changes to the record must be identifiable\).

\(i\) **Operational Rules**: framework governing operation of the electronic system should be geared towards the achievement of desired outcomes.

\(ii\)** Data Integrity**: system must incorporate techniques to protect data from tampering and external attacks.

\(iii\) **Unauthorised access and use:** Who is permitted to enter data and method for becoming a system user are relevant considerations, as well as vulnerabilities to internal attacks.

\(iv\) **Security of hardware and software:** may bring into play worker complacency.

\(v\) **Audit: system **may need to be audited prior to going live, and regularly thereafter, to check for vulnerabilities.

\(vi\) **External Assessment and \(vii\) Industry standards**: International Organisation for Standardisation \(ISO\) provides benchmarks against which system may be assessed: Technology-specific standards, as well as general Quality, Risk Management, Business Continuity and Security Management Standards developed by ISO may apply.
